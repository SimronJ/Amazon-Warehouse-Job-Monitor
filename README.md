## üîß Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Amazon's Security Token System
**Challenge:** Amazon's hiring portal uses a complex security token system to prevent automated access.

**Solution:** Implemented a sophisticated token generation system that:
- Mimics browser fingerprinting
- Handles token refresh automatically
- Manages security challenges
- Uses proper headers to avoid detection

### 2. Rate Limiting
**Challenge:** Frequent API calls could trigger rate limits or IP blocks.

**Solution:**
- Implemented delay between requests (500ms)
- Added retry mechanism for failed requests
- Proper error handling for rate limit responses
- Discord notification throttling (100ms between webhooks)

### 3. Data Processing
**Challenge:** Raw job data needed significant processing to be useful.

**Solution:**
- Created a robust formatting system
- Implemented weekly pay calculations
- Added distance-based sorting
- Structured shift information clearly

### 4. Discord Integration
**Challenge:** Needed to handle different types of notifications without hitting Discord's rate limits.

**Solution:**
- Created separate notification types (jobs, status, errors)
- Implemented color coding for different message types
- Added detailed error reporting with stack traces
- Managed webhook rate limits
